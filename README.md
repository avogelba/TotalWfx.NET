# TotalWfx.NET
.NET wrapper for Total Commander file system plugin API

### Current state
Program is in early stage of development. Basic functionality is already working, but most is yet to come. API is not stable yet and until version 1.0.0 is released, you should expect breaking changes in API to happen frequently.
